### About the image 
The header image on this page is from the [*About South Hall*](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/about/southhall) page that the School maintains. The South Hall is the oldest building that still stands on campus. Ironically, we are both the oldest physical building still standing, and the School that first held classes in a digital classroom. The whole Berkeley campus has joined us online this semester.
