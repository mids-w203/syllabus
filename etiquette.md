# Etiquette for w203: _How to be a courteous learner_

These rules of thumb will help you look awesome in the eyes of your instructors, TAs, and fellow students

**0. Respect your colleagues and their time.**
> This is the most important thing to keep in mind and forms the basis for our other rules
The amazing accomplished people that you meet in the program are 
as busy or busier than you. Often they are doing impressive things professionally while balancing personal
relationships, children,  and the significant demands of the program. Treat them as such.

**1. Read the syllabus first.**
> A significant portion of the quesitons that we recieve are answered in [the syllabus](https://mids-w203.github.io/syllabus/).
Make sure you read it before you post.

**2. Try to ask you quesitons in the w203 channel or office hours. Don't abuse slack DMs.**
> If you have a statistics question (_or a process question that isn't answered in 
[the syllabus](https://mids-w203.github.io/syllabus/)_) ask it in the main slack channel.
>
> _I guarantee that you aren't the only one with that quesiton, and even if you are, so what?
That just gives your fellow students an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and lend a hand._

> If the quesiton is about your specific homework and the approach you are taking, ask it
> in an office hour
> 
> _w203 offers more than a dozen hours of dedicated offic hour time a week where we are more than 
> happy to answer any specific quesitons that you bring with regard to approach._

**3. Give background. Make your questions easy to answer.**
> When you ask a question whether in the channel or in a DM, **give enough informaiton so that any
> question answerers don't have to leave slack to answer it**. This will make your question more likely 
> to be answered and it will endear you to other students who aren't as deep into it as you, because
> they'll get more out of it. 

> Ex: Do **NOT** ask:
>> I didn't understand Async 1.7. Why is the answer for part 3 not B?
>
> _Unless someone happens to have that section loaded and in front of their face, they'll have to switch tasks,
> go to their internet browser, log into ISVC check back on slack to see what section you had a question on..._

> Ex: **DO** ask:
>> I was having trouble understanding why the answer for part 3 of this quesiton from asynch is the
>> empty set instead of "B". I might not be understanding what the `\` operator does. (See screen cap for context)
>> <img width=50% alt="Screen Cap" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mids-w203/syllabus/main/images/screen_cap_question.png">
>
> _Adding a screen capture reduces time needed to answer a question by an order of magnitude. Keep this in mind
> when asking "On Q2.5 of HW6, I don't understand..." etc._

**4. Be careful "@-ing" in the main channel**
> When you "@" someone in the main channel, not only does it put someone on the spot, it makes it less likely that 
> your quesiton will get answered. When people see an `@paul.laskowski` they automatically read your question as
> "_Not my problem_" even if they're capable of answering it. Meanwhile, Paul is only one very busy man and he doesn't
> have the bandwidth to answer every question as it crosses his slack. Even if he intends to answer it, it's easy for
> it to slip through the cracks.

**5. Watch each other's backs**
> The program as a whole and this course in particular is a **struggle**. Everyone comes in with different 
> complementary skill sets. We have traditional engineers and physicist and progammers and product managers and
> priests and while one person (_or many_) might not have done calculus in a decade, another person might not have written
> a line of code in years. You have an amazing diversity of skills. Share those with each other. Take a moment to 
> try to answer a slack question or join a study group. Explaining a concept to others deepens your own understanding
> of the topic and helps you get the most out of it. Similarly, if you're struggling know that lots of people are
> and don't be afraid to stop and ask "basic" questions.
