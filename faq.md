## The class doesn't show up when I log into Gradescope. What's the invite code?

>To get logged in to gradescope the first time please use the following steps:
>
>1. Click “Log In” in the upper right hand corner
>1. Put your “@ischool.berkeley.edu” email in on the email line
>1. Click “Forgot your Password?”
>1. Follow the reset link that gets sent  to your berkeley email
>1. Use your new password along with your “@ischool.berkeley.edu” email address to log in
>
>_Using the “School Credentials” option from the login won’t work and you’ll be taken to

## How do I access to the course GitHub. My invite expired.

>You just need another invite. We can send you a new one.

>#datasci-203-github-gradescope-requests channel on slack indicating that you need to 
>be added to the GitHub.
>
>If you don't have a GitHub account yet, just mention that and give one of your berkeley emails
>instead of your GitHub username. We can send the invite to the email and you'll be prompted 
>to create the account when you click through the invite. 

## I have access to the GitHub but I can't clone it. 

>Since late 2021, GitHub has required "personal access tokens" to access GitHub resouces from 
>the terminal. You can follow their docs to create one and then clone away.
