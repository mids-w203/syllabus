# Zombie Syllabus

This was the "Syllabus" page for the MIDS w203 course. The course is still alive! But, the need for this syllabus has been obviated by the transition from 2U's LMS over to bCourses. ðŸ§Ÿ

We've pulled the `etiquette.md` and `faq.md` content over into the active course materials and adapted them for their current deployment.

# Archive 

This archive continues to exist, in case we need to raise it from the dead in the future, but contributions that are intended to be student facing shouldn't go here for now.
